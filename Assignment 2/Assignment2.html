    <h3>Biography</h3>
    <p>
      I was born and raised in California where I from an <b>EARLY</b> age
      learned to love electronics. Becasue of this I have alwaysed messed around
      with <mark>computers</mark>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This lead me to want to look into coding. I went
      <sup>back</sup><sub>and</sub><sup>forth</sup> on if I could learn it on my
      own, but quickly realzed that coding took alot of <i>finesse</i> and
      decided to enroll at our school
